### Why Plan, Why Now?

There are several reasons why people have not created their own comprehensive plan.
We have put together a top 10 list of those reasons. Take a look and see if any of them
apply to you, and then check out our suggestions...

* 1) It's not something I want to think about.
* 2) I don't know where to start.
* 3) I already have a will, and another country.
* 4) It doesn't matter I'll be gone.
* 5) I'll get around to it later.
* 6) It's expensive.
* 7) I don't own enough that it would matter.
* 8) It's complicated and I don't know who I can trust.
* 9) I live by myself and don't have anyone to leave possessions to.
* 10) I'm going to live forever.
