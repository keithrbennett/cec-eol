### Why Plan, Why Now?

There are several reasons why people have not created their own comprehensive plan.
We have put together a top 10 list of those reasons. Take a look and see if any of them
apply to you, and then check out our suggestions...

1. It's not something I want to think about.
1. I don't know where to start.
1. I already have a will, and another country.
1. It doesn't matter I'll be gone.
1. I'll get around to it later.
1. It's expensive.
1. I don't own enough that it would matter.
1. It's complicated and I don't know who I can trust.
1. I live by myself and don't have anyone to leave possessions to.
1. I'm going to live forever.
